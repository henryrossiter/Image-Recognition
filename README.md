# Geometric Image Recognition

Introductory image recognition project. Eventually, should be able to differentiate between images of different geometric shape

Envisioned Aspects:
+ Compress images
+ Find corners
  + Use Python's OpenCV library
+ Save ocrner locations in appropriate data structure
+ Artificial Neural Network will differentiate between images of triangle, circles, etc. 
  + Will have to be trained with labeled dataset
